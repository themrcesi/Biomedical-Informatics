# InformationRetrievalSystem

In this directory you can find an information retrieval engine for the [CORD-19 corpus](https://github.com/allenai/cord19).

We implement different models and evaluate their performance on this corpus.

## TFIDF Model

## Word2Vec Model

## Notebook

All the implementation was done in [this notebook](src/IRSystem.ipynb).

We can split this notebook into four main sections:
- Preprocessing data
- Loading data
- Models implementation
- Evaluation
